# challenge-4-code-quiz

## Description

- What was your motivation?
  The motivation behind the project was to build a working dynamic quiz game. The game was to have a starting page, a series of timed questions, and a results page for score and initial input for records. I pushed myself to get it 100% completed but fell just short, with some bugs to work out in the future.

- Why did you build this project?
  I built this project to put my JavaScript skills to the test, as well as light CSS and HTML. It combined styling with functionality and linking separate pages together.

- What problem does it solve?
  This project solves the problem of linking all the lessons we have learned so far about JavaScript into a culmination of various elements of the language, not limited to: functions, variable declarations, local storage, loops, iterating over arrays, and more.

- What did you learn?
  I learned a lot about the nuances of JavaScript and the importance of the order things must go in. A seemingly innocent line in the wrong place can cause havoc on an application.
  I learned the importance of pseudo coding and just how far it can take you, especially if you hit a roadblock.

## Usage

The application runs in the browser and comprises of a few screens presented to the user.
