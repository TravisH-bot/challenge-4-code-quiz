# challenge-4-code-quiz

## Description

- What was your motivation?
  The motivation behind the project was to build a working dynamic quiz game. The game was to have a starting page, a series of timed questions, and a results page for score and initial input for records. I pushed myself to get it 100% completed but fell just short, with some bugs to work out in the future.

- Why did you build this project?
  I built this project to put my JavaScript skills to the test, as well as light CSS and HTML. It combined styling with functionality and linking separate pages together.

- What problem does it solve?
  This project solves the problem of linking all the lessons we have learned so far about JavaScript into a culmination of various elements of the language, not limited to: functions, variable declarations, local storage, loops, iterating over arrays, and more.

- What did you learn?
  I learned a lot about the nuances of JavaScript and the importance of the order things must go in. A seemingly innocent line in the wrong place can cause havoc on an application.
  I learned the importance of pseudo coding and just how far it can take you, especially if you hit a roadblock.

## Usage

TThe application runs in the browser and consists of a few screens presented to the user. The initial screen is the Start page consisting of a button to start the quiz and a link in the upper left-hand corner to view the High Scores page.

Once the quiz begins, there will be a series of questions for the user to answer. Clicking an answer will present the next question.

Finally, once the last question has been answered, the user will be presented with the High Scores page to enter their initials to store among the rest.
