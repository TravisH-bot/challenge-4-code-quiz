//MAIN PAGE FUNCTIONALITY

We want a main page with a Title, quiz description, a button to start the quiz, a link to the scores page, and the timer set to 0. 

When we press the button, we want the title, quiz description, and start quiz button to disappear and the first quiz question to display. 

//How do I get the initial information to disappear/be replaced by the first question? 
-Could this be done with DOM manipulation and have each section of questions be shown or hidden based on the data-set? 

//How can I go about selecting an answer, correct or incorrect, and knowing which is which? 
-This can likely be done using an array of objects, creating an if statement that: 
-if the correct answer is chosen; 
  display the Correct! message on screen,
  add to the score,
  move to next question.

-if the incorrect answer is chosen;
  display the Incorrect! message on screen,
  subtract from the timer,
  move to the next question. 

    //How can I get the timer to stop and display the time left if all questions are answered in time?
    -The score appears to be the time remaining on the timer. So, this would be what we need to capture as the score for each round. 

//How can I get the timer to be persistent on the screen?

//How can I have the timer begin at 0 and only start the countdown on press of the star quiz button?
-I think this can be triggered by adding an event listener to the start quiz button.


//How do I then get the next question to appear after answering the first one?
-First thought that comes to mind is DOM manipulation to change out the button questions rather than coding sections for each button???

-or pull from the array of questions to display the information. 

//How do I display a temporary message indicating a correct/incorrect message? 
-Maybe based on an event listener attached to the quiz buttons, 

//How to I tally the score from each correct answer? 
-This can likely be achieved similarly to the R,P,S game by combining if/else statements (if true score++)

//How do I remove time from the clock (10 seconds at a time) if an incorrect answer is selected? 
-Again this can likely be achieved similarly to the R,P,S game (if false subtract time in some way? timer--?)

//What elements do I need to create the end of quiz page?
An All done! message, the total score achieved, an input form, and a submit button.

//How is the end quiz page reached? 
-This will be reached by either the user answering all the questions or by running out of time. Function?

//How can I create the end of quiz page to include an input form to store the results on the scores page?
-This can likely be achieved by storing the .value from the input field into local storage upon submitting, making the scores persistent. 

//How can I create a function to clear out the scores page?

//How can I use a button to "go back" to the start of the quiz?






//NOTES/OBSERVATIONS
-It appears the main title on the start page, the question titles, the All done! message, and Highscores title, all share the same formatting. 
-All the buttons share the same formatting. 

-if (answer) {
  return nextQuestion;
} else {
  return nextQuestion && timer--;
}
